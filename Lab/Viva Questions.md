# Deep Viva Questions - Data Communication Lab

## 🧪 Experiment 1: Line Coding (NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester)

### Core Concepts
- **NRZ-L**: Direct voltage representation (1=High, 0=Low)
- **NRZ-I**: Transition on '1', no change on '0'
- **Manchester**: Mid-bit transition (1=High-to-Low, 0=Low-to-High)

### Deep Questions

**Q1: Why does NRZ-L fail during long sequences of identical bits?**
*Answer:* Long sequences produce no signal transitions, causing clock drift. The receiver's clock loses synchronization because it relies on edge transitions to maintain timing alignment. Without transitions, bit boundaries become ambiguous.

**Q2: How does NRZ-I solve the synchronization problem, and what are its limitations?**
*Answer:* NRZ-I ensures transitions on every '1' bit, providing regular clock recovery points. However, long sequences of '0's still cause synchronization issues. It's better than NRZ-L but not perfect.

**Q3: Why is Manchester called "self-clocking"?**
*Answer:* Every bit period contains exactly one transition at the mid-point, allowing the receiver to extract both data and timing information simultaneously. The clock can be recovered from the data stream itself.

**Q4: What is the bandwidth penalty of Manchester encoding?**
*Answer:* Manchester requires twice the bandwidth because each bit is represented by two signal levels. For a 10 Mbps data rate, the signal frequency is 20 MHz.

**Q5: Why isn't Manchester used in high-speed networks like Gigabit Ethernet?**
*Answer:* The bandwidth doubling becomes prohibitive at high speeds. It would require 2 GHz signaling for 1 Gbps data, causing excessive EMI and requiring more expensive cables.

## 🧪 Experiment 2: Multi-level Coding (AMI, Pseudoternary, MLT-3)

### Core Concepts
- **AMI**: '0'=0V, '1'=alternating ±V
- **Pseudoternary**: '1'=0V, '0'=alternating ±V
- **MLT-3**: Three levels (0,+1,-1), cyclic transitions on '1'

### Deep Questions

**Q6: How does AMI achieve DC balance and why is this important?**
*Answer:* Alternating polarity for '1's creates equal positive and negative voltages over time, resulting in zero DC component. This is crucial for:
- Transformer coupling in long-distance transmission
- Preventing baseline wander
- Reducing power consumption in AC-coupled systems

**Q7: When would you choose Pseudoternary over AMI?**
*Answer:* When the data stream has more '0's than '1's. Since '0's get transitions in Pseudoternary, it provides better clock recovery for such data patterns.

**Q8: Explain the MLT-3 state machine and its advantages.**
*Answer:* MLT-3 cycles through states: 0 → +1 → 0 → -1 → 0
- On '1': Move to next state
- On '0': Stay in current state

Advantages:
- Reduces fundamental frequency by ~3x compared to NRZ
- Lower EMI emissions
- Better spectral efficiency
- Used in 100BASE-TX

**Q9: Why doesn't MLT-3 have DC balance issues like NRZ?**
*Answer:* The three-level cyclic nature ensures that over time, the signal spends equal time at each level, naturally achieving DC balance without requiring complex encoding rules.

## 🧪 Experiment 3: Bit Stuffing

### Core Concepts
- Prevents data from being mistaken for control characters
- Uses escape sequences (\ before special characters)
- Frame delimiters (@) separate messages

### Deep Questions

**Q10: Why is bit stuffing necessary in byte-oriented protocols?**
*Answer:* User data can contain any bit pattern, including control sequences. Bit stuffing ensures data transparency - the protocol can reliably distinguish between actual control characters and data that happens to look like control characters.

**Q11: What happens if the escape character itself appears in data?**
*Answer:* The escape character (\) is doubled (\\) to distinguish it from its use as an escape. This prevents confusion during de-stuffing.

**Q12: How does bit stuffing relate to HDLC flag sequences?**
*Answer:* HDLC uses bit stuffing with flag 01111110. When five consecutive 1's appear in data, a 0 is stuffed after them to prevent false flag detection.

**Q13: What are the overhead implications of bit stuffing?**
*Answer:* Overhead depends on data content. In worst case (data full of escape characters), overhead can be 100%. In typical data, overhead is much lower (1-5%).

## 🧪 Experiment 4: Multiplexing & Demultiplexing

### Core Concepts
- **TDM**: Time Division Multiplexing - each source gets fixed time slots
- Round-robin scheduling for fair bandwidth allocation
- Synchronization markers for proper demultiplexing

### Fundamental Multiplexing Theory

**What is Multiplexing?**
A technique allowing multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously over a single communication channel. Essential when link capacity exceeds individual device needs.

### Types of Multiplexing

#### 1. **FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)**
- **Type**: Analog technique
- **Method**: Each signal assigned different frequency band
- **Process**: Signals modulated with different carrier frequencies
- **Example**: Radio broadcasting, TV channels
- **Limitation**: Requires guard bands → bandwidth waste

#### 2. **WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)**
- **Type**: Optical technique (like FDM for fiber)
- **Method**: Different wavelengths (colors) of light
- **Application**: Internet backbone, fiber optic systems
- **Technology**: Uses prisms/diffraction gratings

#### 3. **TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)**
- **Type**: Digital technique
- **Method**: Time slots allocated in turns
- **Synchronous TDM**: Fixed slots even if idle
- **Statistical TDM**: Dynamic slot allocation
- **Example**: Your lab implementation, telephone networks

### Deep Questions

**Q14: How does your TDM implementation ensure synchronization?**
*Answer:* By maintaining fixed time slots per round and using padding (#) for inactive sources. This preserves slot alignment, allowing the receiver to correctly demultiplex data back to original files.

**Q15: What is the difference between Synchronous and Statistical TDM?**
*Answer:* 
- **Synchronous TDM**: Fixed slots allocated whether source has data or not
- **Statistical TDM**: Slots allocated dynamically based on demand
- Your implementation is synchronous TDM

**Q16: What problems arise if TDM loses synchronization?**
*Answer:* Loss of synchronization causes:
- Data from one source mixed with another
- Frame boundaries lost
- Complete communication failure
- Need for resynchronization mechanisms

**Q17: How would you implement priority-based TDM?**
*Answer:* Assign more time slots to high-priority sources within each round, or give high-priority sources access to unused slots from other sources.

**Q18: Why is FDM considered bandwidth inefficient?**
*Answer:* FDM requires guard bands between channels to prevent interference and crosstalk. These guard bands waste spectrum that could otherwise carry data.

**Q19: What makes WDM more efficient than FDM in optical networks?**
*Answer:* Light wavelengths can be packed more densely with less interference. Optical systems can carry many distinct wavelengths simultaneously without the guard band requirements of electrical FDM.

**Q20: Can you combine different multiplexing techniques?**
*Answer:* Yes - hybrid multiplexing is common:
- **FDM + TDM**: Used in cellular networks (different frequencies + time slots)
- **WDM + TDM**: Optical networks with time-slotted wavelengths
- **CDMA + TDM**: 3G/4G systems

**Q21: What is the main limitation of synchronous TDM?**
*Answer:* Bandwidth waste due to idle time slots. If a source has no data, its slot is still transmitted (often filled with padding), reducing overall efficiency compared to statistical TDM.

## 🧪 Experiment 5: CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)

### Core Concepts
- Polynomial-based error detection
- Uses modulo-2 arithmetic (XOR)
- Appends remainder as checksum

### Deep Questions

**Q18: Why is CRC more powerful than simple parity checking?**
*Answer:* 
- **Parity**: Detects only odd number of errors
- **CRC**: Detects burst errors, multiple errors, and has much lower probability of undetected errors
- CRC can detect any error burst shorter than the generator polynomial degree

**Q19: Explain the mathematics behind CRC error detection.**
*Answer:* CRC treats data as polynomials in GF(2). If E(x) is the error polynomial and G(x) is the generator, an error is undetected only if E(x) is divisible by G(x). Good generators make this probability very low.

**Q20: What makes a good CRC generator polynomial?**
*Answer:* A good generator polynomial should:
- Be irreducible (cannot be factored)
- Have degree k for k-bit CRC
- Detect all burst errors of length ≤ k
- Have good distance properties

**Q21: Why do we append k-1 zeros before CRC calculation?**
*Answer:* This creates space for the CRC remainder. The k-1 zeros allow the division to produce a remainder of maximum k-1 bits, which replaces these zeros in the final codeword.

**Q22: How does CRC perform in the presence of burst errors?**
*Answer:* CRC can detect:
- All single-bit errors
- All burst errors of length ≤ generator degree
- 99.97% of longer burst errors (for well-chosen generators)

## 🧪 Experiment 7: Spreading Techniques

### Core Concepts
- Data bits repeated and XORed with chip sequences
- Increases bandwidth but improves robustness
- Foundation for CDMA systems

### Spread Spectrum Theory

**What is Spread Spectrum?**
A technique where signals are spread over a wider frequency band than necessary, providing security, anti-jamming capabilities, and bandwidth sharing.

**Key Benefits:**
- Resistance to jamming
- Resistance to eavesdropping  
- Multiple users on same bandwidth
- Improved signal integrity

### Types of Spread Spectrum

#### 1. **FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)**
- **Method**: Signal rapidly hops between multiple carrier frequencies
- **Requirement**: Transmitter and receiver must synchronize hop pattern
- **Advantage**: Difficult to intercept or jam
- **Applications**: Bluetooth, military communications
- **Your Lab**: Not implemented, but conceptually similar to frequency diversity

#### 2. **DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)**
- **Method**: Signal multiplied by pseudo-random bit stream (chip code)
- **Process**: Spreads data across wide frequency band
- **Recovery**: Receiver uses same chip to reconstruct original message
- **Applications**: Wi-Fi (802.11b), GPS, your lab implementation
- **Your Lab**: This is what you implemented with chip codes

### Deep Questions

**Q23: How does spreading improve signal robustness against interference?**
*Answer:* 
- Original signal energy is spread across wider bandwidth
- Interference typically affects only part of the spread spectrum
- Processing gain = (Chip rate)/(Data rate) provides interference rejection
- Even if some chips are corrupted, majority voting can recover original data

**Q24: What is the relationship between chip rate and processing gain?**
*Answer:* Processing gain = Chip rate ÷ Data rate. Higher chip rates provide more processing gain, meaning better interference rejection and ability to operate below noise floor.

**Q25: Why use XOR for spreading instead of simple repetition?**
*Answer:* XOR provides:
- Reversible operation (XOR with same chip recovers data)
- Pseudo-random spreading pattern
- Better spectral properties
- Enables multiple access (different chips for different users)

**Q26: How does CDMA achieve multiple access using spreading?**
*Answer:* Each user gets a unique orthogonal chip sequence. Multiple users can transmit simultaneously on same frequency. Receiver correlates received signal with specific chip to extract desired user's data.

**Q27: Why does Spread Spectrum offer better security?**
*Answer:* Data appears as noise to unintended receivers. Without knowing the chip sequence or hop pattern, it's computationally infeasible to decode the message.

**Q28: What's the fundamental trade-off in spread spectrum?**
*Answer:* You intentionally increase bandwidth usage in exchange for:
- Enhanced security
- Improved robustness against interference
- Multiple access capability
- Anti-jamming properties

**Q29: How does DSSS resist narrowband interference?**
*Answer:* Since data is spread across wide bandwidth, narrowband interference affects only a small portion of the signal. The receiver can still recover the message using correlation with the known chip sequence.

**Q30: Compare FHSS vs DSSS synchronization requirements:**
*Answer:*
- **FHSS**: Requires precise timing synchronization for hop sequence
- **DSSS**: Requires chip sequence synchronization and phase alignment
- Both fail completely if synchronization is lost

**Q31: How does your lab implementation relate to real CDMA systems?**
*Answer:* Your implementation demonstrates basic DSSS principles:
- Chip code spreading
- XOR-based encoding/decoding
- Processing gain concepts
Real CDMA adds: orthogonal codes, power control, rake receivers
