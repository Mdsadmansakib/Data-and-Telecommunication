| **Self-Synchronization** | Poor (no transitions in long 0s or 1s)   | Poor (no transitions in long 0s)          | Excellent (transition every bit)               | Excellent (transition every bit)               | Good (transitions on 1s only)                 |

| **Bandwidth Efficiency** | High (narrow bandwidth)                  | High (narrow bandwidth)                   | Low (needs 2x bandwidth)                       | Low (needs 2x bandwidth)                       | Moderate                                      |
